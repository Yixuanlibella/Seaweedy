                <p>Attach your right arm high and the left arm low, slightly bended,  and try to spin with your right feet as the anchor point, kicking the left leg out and tighten up your core, you will start spinning to the clock direction. Then, gentlely split your leg out(it does not need to be massive).</p>

                <p>Then, step your feet on the floor and do a cross-over step. In the process of doing so, leaning your arm toward the pole and tuck your armpit into the pole. Try to lean back and kick your legs out to the opposite direction, this will increase the push of spinning. You will start spinning into opposite(counterclock wise position). </p>

            <div class="text-box">
                <p>After stepping for a while, set your feet down and kick your right leg into the air! Your arm needs to be attached to the pole for the whole time. Then, bend the back lag and lean backward. You will start to spin into the clockwise direct again. After a few moments, you can stop the spinning and try to play with your seaweedy dress. Whoa-la! You have mastered the tricks of moving like the seaweed. </p>
