            You stand at the edge of life’s boundless ocean, the waves crashing relentlessly against you. Each surge feels like a force trying to pull you back, while unseen obstacles cloud your vision. You’re weary, battling currents that seem unyielding. Yet, in this moment, you realize: resistance is not the answer. Instead, embrace the rhythm of the sea. Become the seaweed—fluid, resilient, bending with the tides but never breaking. You will thrive, not by resisting the waves, but by flowing with them.
